    Boogie (sometimes called electro-funk or post-disco) is a genre of electronic
    dance music, that combines stylistic features of post-disco with funk, that
    first emerged in the United States during the late 1970s to mid-1980s. The
    sound of boogie defined by bridging acoustic and electronic musical
    instruments with emphasis on vocals and miscellaneous effects later evolved
    into electro and house music

    This subreddit is dedicated to musical mashups.



    A mashup is a song or composition created by blending two or more
    pre-recorded songs, usually by overlaying the vocal track of one song
    seamlessly over the instrumental track of another.



    Looking for new mashups? Have one you can't remember the name of? Have
    a request for a song or information? This is the place.
